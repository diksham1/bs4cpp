I will be using the HTMLCXX parser and the tree.h API. I'll implement the major functions available in BeautifulSoup in the BS4CPP library. 

As of now, the functions completed are :

    - Find_all and find function
    - The contents member variable
    - The prettify function
    - The parent function 
    - Attributes dictionary ready
    - previous_sibling and next_sibling 
    - previous_element and next_element
    - descendant function added
